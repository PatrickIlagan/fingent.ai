# FinGent

FinGent is a local-first dashboard for personal finance, ventures, freelancing, investments, career progress, and planning.

## Run locally

1. Install Node.js 20 or later.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add `GEMINI_API_KEY` only if you choose to enable the assistant.
4. Start the app with `npm run dev`.
5. Open http://localhost:3000.

The app stores its SQLite database locally in `data/`. It is intentionally excluded from Git so personal financial records stay on your machine.

## Checks

- `npm run lint` validates TypeScript.
- `npm run build` creates a production build.

## Main areas

- Accounts, transactions, liabilities, budgets, goals, calendar, and taxes
- Investments and portfolio transaction history
- Venture-specific Store, SaaS, and Agency dashboards
- Freelance services, contracts, invoices, time tracking, and PDF invoices
- Career tracking and settings

The Gemini assistant is optional and is not required for the finance dashboard to work.
